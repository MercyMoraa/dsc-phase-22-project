### The Data
This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv`. The dataset had a number of independent variables which had an impact on the price of the houses.

##Conclusion and Recommendations
The model presented above will be used for predictive purposes and anybother inferential need that may arise in the agency company. The model has ticked all the boxes needed for linear regression, In that it has satisfied the assumption of linearity, normality and homoscedascticity. The model has also satisfied the assumption that all observed variables are independent of each other.
Through this model, we saw that as the amenities of the house increased, the prices increased. The squarefoots had a major impact to the price of the homes.
From the conclusions above, we hughlighted the features that were more likely to influence the price of the house:
1. The higher the footage of the home, the higher the price value for the house.
2. The number of bedrooms. Houses with more number of bedrooms were more valued than those with ess
3. The number of floors. Houses with2-3 floors showed a higher price value than those with less 
4. The condition. Houses with better living conditions we
